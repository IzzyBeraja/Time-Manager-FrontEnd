# Touch Typing React App

This project aims to be a way to help people learn how to type more efficiently.
It aims to support different keyboard layouts and allow for personalized tests.
More importantly, it serves as a way for me to better understand how to utilize
TypeScript with React.

## Layout

As a template, I will be using a layout of a similar website that I have used
for over 10 hours and have learned how to type using the Colemak keyboard setup.

The name of the site is [KeyBr](https://www.keybr.com) and I would highly recommend you to
check it out as I have done over 1000+ tests and have been able to improve my
typing from 20wpm to an average of 75wpm.

## Goals

This project has the following goals and pieces that I would like to implement:

- [x] Handle keypresses from the user
- [x] Vertical navigation bar
- [ ] Statistics
- [ ] Support different keyboard layouts
- [ ] Usage of advertisements?
- [ ] High scores
- [ ] Customized tests
- [ ] Markdown for pages with text
- [ ] Animations of keyboard comparisons

And much more!

This project is just to have fun and to get a better feel for TypeScript and to
practice. I will be adding a backend at some point to store High Scores and
potentially handle multiplayer but that wouldn't be for a little while!
