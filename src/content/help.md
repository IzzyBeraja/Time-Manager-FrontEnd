# Using TypingTest.com

It's as easy as pressing your keys on the keyboard! In the [Practice](/practice)
menu, there will be provided sample text. All you have to do is click it and
type! Once you've completed your first test, your results will be displayed at
the top. As you complete more tests, the results at the top will show you how
you've improved.

If you want to change settings, you can do so with the settings button on the
practice menu.

If you would like to submit a passage, you can do so in the future. Currently
the feature is in developement.

## Other Helpful Information

Here are a list of my tips:

- Make sure that you are in a comfortable position when typing. If you are not,
  over time you may feel pain in your wrists.
- Keep your fingers on the center of the keyboard as much as you can
  - If your hands drift around too much, you may type slower
- Slow but steady wins the race!
  - Practice the movements before you try to speed through a test. Just because
    your keyboard is making more noise, doesn't mean you are going any faster ðŸ˜‚
- Don't look down!
  - As much as you may want to look down, searching for a key is much slower
    than having the muscle memory to know where it is.
  - Practice as much as you can without looking down to type even faster!
- Try a different keyboard layout (if you have patience and are a little crazy)
  - Different keyboard layouts provide ways to type without moving around your
    hands as much
  - Some layouts also have the added bonus of being better for posture and long
    amounts of typing
- Finally, have fun! Typing fast isn't something that comes without practice.
  Take your time and get a feel for the world of speed typing!
