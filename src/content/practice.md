# Typing Test

Test your typing skills with an interactive test. This typing program has been
modeled after the typing test at [Keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com) and I highly
recommend that you check them out!

## What is Touch Typing?

Touch typing is the ability to type without the need to use your eyes and
relying solely on your muscle memory to write. It's like being able to ride a
bike except with your fingers, indoors, and instead of a sprained ankle, carpal
tunnel. It's an exceedingly efficient way to get information from your head to
your work and is an extremely important skill in today's day and age.

## How Do Typing Tests Work?

Typing tests work by practicing on increasingly more difficult typing exams.
This typing software slowly increases the scope and difficulty of tests as you
type more and more. At first, tests will consist of simple key combinations but
as you progress, there will be passages to keep you busy.

This kind of practice can be challenging at first but proves to be really
addicting after a while. Race against your own times from previously completed
passages to see how you've improved! Not convinced that you're getting better?

Want to learn a new keyboard layout but aren't interested in changing your
keyboard settings? Try layout emulations to experience where the keys are
without the hassle! It may be hard to get into the grove of things, but the
amount of improvement possible will be invaluable in the long run.
